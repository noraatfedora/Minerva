    <h4>
        Who is this for?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Anyone in need of free food, people at risk for the Coronavirus who shouldn't go to the
        grocery store, and essential workers that don't have time to make grocery trips.
    </p>
    <h4>
        How is this done in a safe manner?
    </h4>
    <p> Only one volunteer goes to the grocery store, we minimize contact between volunteers, boxes
        of food are sprayed with alcohol, and food is dropped at your door without any human contact.
    </p>
    <h4>
        How much food can I get?
    </h4>
    <p>
        You can order once per week. Each item as a defined maximum, see the <a href="/request_items">request page</a>
        for more information.
